# Home Automation System

## Description
This Arduino-based project implements a room automation system using sensors and actuators. It includes functionality for controlling lights and fans based on occupancy and temperature conditions in two separate rooms. The system uses a PIR motion sensor to detect occupancy and temperature sensors to monitor room temperature. It provides automated control of lights and fans to enhance energy efficiency and user comfort.

## Components Used
-> Arduino Uno <br>
-> PIR Motion Sensor <br>
-> Temperature Sensors <br>
-> Relay Modules <br>
-> LEDs <br>
-> LCD Display (16x2) <br>
-> Other basic electronic components (resistors, wires, etc.) <br>

## Features
Room 1 Automation:<br>

-> Controls room light based on occupancy. <br>
-> Activates fan based on temperature threshold. <br>
Room 2 Automation: <br>

-> Controls LED indicator based on occupancy. <br>
-> Activates fan based on temperature threshold. <br>
LCD Display: <br>

-> Shows room status and welcome messages. <br>
Temperature Monitoring: <br>

-> Displays real-time temperature values on the LCD. <br>
Installation <br>
Hardware Setup: <br>

Connect the PIR motion sensors, temperature sensors, relays, LEDs, and LCD display to the Arduino Uno as per the circuit diagram. <br>
Software Setup: <br>

Install the necessary libraries: <br>
Adafruit LiquidCrystal library for the LCD display. <br>
Upload the room_automation.ino sketch to your Arduino Uno using the Arduino IDE. <br>
Run the System: <br>

Power up the Arduino Uno. <br>
Observe the LCD display for room status and temperature readings. <br>
Test the automation system by entering and exiting rooms to observe light and fan control based on occupancy and temperature. <br>
Circuit Diagram <br>
Include a brief description of the circuit setup and a schematic diagram (if available) to help users replicate the setup. <br>

Usage <br>
Room 1: <br>
Enter Room 1 to activate the light and fan based on occupancy and temperature conditions. <br>
Room 2: <br>
Enter Room 2 to activate the LED indicator and fan based on occupancy and temperature conditions. <br>
